# 👋 Introduction
 
?> ... it's pronounced /ˈkwɪr..ɪŋ/ or just _querying_ 

**qryn** is a _fast, thin, all-in-one_ _**polyglot**_ observability stack built on top of _**ClickHouse**_

_Logs, Metrics and Traces made simple, right out of the box - batteries included!_ 🔋


<!-- tabs:start -->

#### ** Ingestion **

🎉 _No custom formats to integrate_ 

Ingestion APIs are transparently compatible with [Loki](logs/ingestion#logql), [Prometheus](metrics/ingestion#prometheus), [Tempo](telemetry/ingestion#zipkin), [InfluxDB](metrics/ingestion#influx), [Elastic](logs/ingestion#elastic) _and others_

**qryn** is ready to use with Agents such as _[Promtail, Grafana-Agent, Vector, Logstash, Telegraf](ingestion.md) and many more_

#### ** Querying **

🎉 _No custom query languages to learn_ 

Start querying logs, metrics and traces instantly using [LogQL, PromQL, Flux or Tempo/Zipkin](getting-started.md)

**qryn** is ready to use with [Grafana datasources](guide/datasources) or using the integrated [View UI](getting-started?id=view) and [CLI](getting-started?id=cli)


#### ** Database **

🎉 _No limits accessing your own data_ 

**qryn** was designed to be cloud native for _serverless and stateless operations_ on top of [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/clickhouse).

Want more than our APIs offer? Access your data using pure ClickHouse SQL _for fun and compliance_.
